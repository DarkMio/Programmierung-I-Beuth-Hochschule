While I am owning the full rights, I really do not care about rights management or full disclosure on anything. I appriciate any support on example-software and general alternative solutions than given here.

Copy pasting my source-code ^(if it is rather big) could get us ^(fellow students) in trouble. Since my versions are online available, you will lose that arguement anyway.
