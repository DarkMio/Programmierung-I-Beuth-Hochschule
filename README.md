####Content Rights

While I am owning the full rights, I really do not care about rights management or full disclosure on anything. I appriciate any support on example-software and general alternative solutions than given here.

Copy pasting my source-code _(if it is rather big)_ could get us _(fellow students)_ in trouble. Since my versions are online available, you will lose that arguement anyway.
